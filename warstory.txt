This is a placeholder for a war story on programming performance.
It supports and details the slide presentation originally prepared 
for a meeting on November 12, 2019, in Sunnyvale, California.

The major takeaway from this is that ignorance can be used as a tool
to realize performance gains in a system quickly.  The mode by which
this occurs is to have developers restrict their focus on a search
space that is small enough to explore quickly for solutions.  In
particular, the developers should force themselves to ignore certain
aspects as mandatory constraints, and seek solutions that do not take
such constraints into account.  Sometimes this allows one to develop
questions and perspectives which result in a satisfactory solution
which can later accommodate the ignored constraints.
